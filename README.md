# WebRTC with react
This is a simple 1-to-1 video chat room example using react with webRTC. This is experimental for learnig purposes. I hope that this project help you to learn something. You can test this on https://video-chat.now.sh put a room id that you want to create and click enter the other peer have to use the same room id. Sometimes it takes a bit longer to connect(no longer than one minute).     


To run this application you need to create a TURN account. You can create one using this service http://numb.viagenie.ca/cgi-bin/numbacct 

Change the `.env.example` to `.env` or `.env.local`

Put your turn account on the .env file
